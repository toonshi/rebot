I've introduced a second bug in `frontend/src/App.jsx`.

The first bug: I changed `useRef` to `userRef` in the import statement, which should cause a clear compilation/runtime error.

The second bug: In the `onDrop` function, I've changed the `id` generation for new nodes from `getId()` to a hardcoded `id: 0`. This will cause issues with unique keys when adding multiple nodes in React Flow, leading to runtime warnings and potential rendering problems.

You now have two bugs to debug with your girlfriend!
